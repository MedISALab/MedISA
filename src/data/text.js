    title: "RESEARCH OVERVIEW",
    description: "The Medical Image Synthesis and Analysis (MedISA) Lab, mentored by Dr. Angshuman Paul, focuses on deep learning, statistical machine learning, and computer vision methods for medical image synthesis, analysis, and quality enhancement with the goal of facilitating affordable healthcare. Our research addresses key problems in clinical imaging, including synthetic and missing data generation, super-resolution, disease diagnosis, and image segmentation. We also study learning from distributed and heterogeneous data sources using federated learning, and develop annotation-efficient models. Our objective is to design robust and reliable learning frameworks for deployment in real-world clinical settings.",
